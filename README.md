Software Security Assessment

•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
•	What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Artemis Financial, a FinTech company handling sensitive data, required enhancements to the security of their existing applications to ensure data protection during transit and at rest. In addressing this, I successfully implemented encryption methods, notably using SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function that secures data by converting it into a virtually irreversable format. This was crucial as it fortified the application against potential data breaches, underscoring the importance of secure coding practices. Secure coding not only safeguards company data but also bolsters the company's reputation by demonstrating reliability and trustworthiness to clients.

•	What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The vulnerability assessment was an insightful process, with the dependency check tool proving particularly useful by efficiently identifying vulnerabilities, which might otherwise require laborious manual checks. This experience highlighted the importance of keeping libraries up-to-date to mitigate security risks effectively.

•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

In my efforts to enhance security, I updated old libraries and employed SSL/TLS for secure communication channels. For future projects, I plan to incorporate penetration testing to uncover and address vulnerabilities more comprehensively.

•	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To ensure the functionality and security of the application post-refactoring, I conducted continuous testing and ran vulnerability assessments to detect any newly introduced security flaws. This iterative process of testing and refinement was vital in maintaining the integrity of the software.

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Throughout this project, resources like Stack Overflow and peer discussions and 24/7 drop in tutoring were invaluable. These platforms provided practical insights and solutions to common coding challenges, which will undoubtedly be beneficial in future assignments.

•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

For potential employers, I would highlight my proactive approach in employing a robust hash function for secure communications and my thorough testing practices that ensure the security and functionality of the software. This project serves as a testament to my ability to implement and maintain high-security standards in software development.
